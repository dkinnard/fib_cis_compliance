# FIB CIS Compliance Remediation

A centralized repo to store all current and future compliance remediation that requires action on the FIB platform.  Please add each solution as a sub directory to this repository, clearly labeled with the operating system and CIS benchmark section as the folder name.  Scripting and automation is preferred, but if a manual response is required, please document the solution with clear directions and screenshots in the sub-directory readme.
